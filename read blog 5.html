        <p class="blog_text">Marketing strategies are more successful on Instagram than on any other social networking platform.

Influencer marketing statistics show that the most-effective influencer content types besides regular Instagram posts are Instagram Stories (73%) and YouTube videos (56%). 

          For this reason, we see more and more online marketplaces where businesses can buy Instagram accounts with a large following and use the marketing potential of the social network.

                  E-commerce refers to a shopping experience via a website or dedicated branded app.
                  Social commerce, by definition, allowing the customer to make their purchase within their social media

                  ocial commerce is not e-commerce. Social commerce is also not social selling. Social selling refers to
                  cultivating relationships on social media in order to build your sales prospect list.

                <p class="blog-text">
                  At the last Influencer Marketing Committee meeting of 2018, several leading marketers shared their brands'

                  a young woman by the name of Ingrid becomes morbidly obsessed by Instagram-famous blogger Taylor.
                  Ingrid becomes infatuated by Taylor’s
                  seemingly perfect life and starts mimicking her every move. Taylor posts a picture of her breakfast at
                  her favorite bagel place, Ingrid
                  stops by for lunch the same day. Taylor quotes a passage from her favorite book, Ingrid orders it

                <p class="blog-text">
                  There’s never been a better time to be a fashionista. After all, those who care about
                  clothes have no shortage of online resources at their disposal to find outfit inspiration and feed
                  and their passion for style. That gives retail brands a built-in advantage: Their fashion blogs rely
                  heavily on visual components, which have shown to drive as much as 94 percent more views compared to
                  posts that only contain text. But there are still roadblocks to building an engaged audience. Today’s
                  consumers are more sophisticated than ever, so for brands to stand out—be it on Instagram, Twitter, or
                  an owned media property—they have to give audiences more than just some pretty pictures.
